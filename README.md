# Task Manager

A simple task manager app built using React.js

## Steps to run the app locally

1. Clone the repo in a local folder(let's call it app_folder) in your machine from this github repo
2. Open VS Code and navigate to app_folder.
3. Open a VS Code terminal and run the following command: `npm install`
4. Wait for the installation of the dependencies to complete by checking on the terminal opened in step #3
5. After installation of dependencies is complete, run the following command: `npm start`
6. On successful execution of the command in step #5 the app will run on "localHost:3000" in your default browser
7. If port 3000 is blocked due to some reason in your system, then the terminal in step #3 will prompt for another port and from there it will guide to run the app locally
